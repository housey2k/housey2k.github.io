ComponentCtrl is a piece of software I developed for managing components. This way whenever I want to build a project I can quickly search to see if I have the needed components in storage.

It stores a local list of components as a CSV file, and handles alldatasheet.com searching to add new components

You can download it on GitHub: [link here](https://github.com/housey2k/ComponentCtrl)
