I got an old "Oi" (a Brazilian internet and phone provider company) router from a relative. After disassembly, I managed to find out it's based on a **Realtek RTL8672 SoC**.

One thing that instantly drew my attention was a **12-pin header** on the board that was really close to the SoC.

After some research, I found out that the pinout of this header is compatible with the one used by the **Linksys WRT54G router**.

I immediately soldered wires to that header, as seen in the picture. But when I tried to connect using my **Bluepill DirtyJTAG adapter**, UrJTAG reported that **TDO was stuck at 0**.

After doing a **diode test** on the header, I discovered that the TDO pin wasn't even connected — it showed **Open Line (O.L.)** on the multimeter.

I followed the traces to some **resistor pads** located right next to the header.

After soldering a jumper wire to **R86**, I got a reverse diode value on the test — meaning the pad was finally connected.

Now when I try to connect, UrJTAG says **TDO is stuck at 1**.

The only thing left to check is whether the **TMS pull-up resistor** is present or also missing.

This post will be updated soon.  
If it works — great.  
If it doesn't — this is the end. I don’t have access to a glitcher, a Bluepill would be too slow, and an FPGA would be way too expensive.
