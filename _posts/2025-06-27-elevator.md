Some months ago some guys were fixing the school elevator, thought i was drowing in shyness, i made sure to take some pictures of the panel :3
They told me the issue was on the stop sensor
				
We can see a big transformer on top left for the low voltage side
Some contactors and MCBs down left
A custom PCB on the top right for the elevator logic (The brand is "ELEVATOR", brilliant)
Something that maybe looks like a PLC on center left
Some relay boards below the main PCB, and some boards next to the PLC that look like a mains rectifier considering the fuse holder, diodes (thought it looks like it's only 3 diodes instead of 4), a capacitor and an LED
Some custom connectors on the right, and terminal blocks down left
And lastly, the hydraulic pump (or HPU, which means Hydraulic Power Unit), which is the heart of this kind of elevator
