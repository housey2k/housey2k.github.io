Some months ago some guys were fixing the school elevator, thought i was drowing in shyness, i made sure to take some pictures of the panel :3

They told me the issue was on the stop sensor. I just thought it looked pretty cool, the attached pictures show the electrical panel, and the hydraulic pump
