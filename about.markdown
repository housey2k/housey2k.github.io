Hey there, and thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet.

This is **Housey2k**, where I dive into all things electronics and hardware hacking — from cool DIY projects to the nitty-gritty behind the tech.

Along the way, I also share some stories and insights from my **school life**, blending the world of circuits with everyday experiences.

Whether you’re a fellow tinkerer, a tech-curious visitor, or just here to see what I’m up to, I’m excited to have you along for the ride.

Let’s build, learn, and hack our way through this together!
