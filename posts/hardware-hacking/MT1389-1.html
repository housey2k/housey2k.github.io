		<h2>Hacking a MT1389 based CD/DVD drive</h2>

			<p>Recently, I found a CD/DVD player in my scrap pile that I don't have the model or much info about (I threw away the casing and kept the circuits). It was missing the actual reader unit; it only has a VFD screen, the main board, and a SMPS board.</p>
			<p>The goal of this project is to hack the firmware that I believe is stored in the A29L040L EEPROM chip located next to the main chip. I don't have a parallel programmer yet, so I'm waiting for an STM32 Bluepill to use as a programmer. I also plan on putting a PLCC32 socket on the motherboard so I don't have to keep reheating the board or EEPROM.</p>
			<p>CN3 appears to be a UART interface, but I couldn't see any data coming through any of the pins.</p>
			<p>I'll be putting here some files I found during OSINT that might be useful:</p>
			
			<p>edit: my STM32 might arrive this week</p>
