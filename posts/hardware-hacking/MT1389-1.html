			<h2>Hacking an MT1389-Based CD/DVD Drive</h2>

				<p>Recently, I dug out a CD/DVD player from my scrap pile, though I no longer have the model info (I tossed the casing a while back and just kept the boards). The unit was missing the actual optical drive, but it still had the VFD display, mainboard, and SMPS board intact.</p>
				<p>The goal of this project is to dump and analyze the firmware, which I believe is stored in the A29L040L EEPROM located next to the main MT1389QE chip. I don’t have a parallel programmer at the moment, so I’m waiting on an STM32 Bluepill to arrive, which I plan to use as a programmer. I’m also planning to install a PLCC32 socket on the board so I can remove the EEPROM easily without having to keep reheating the board.</p>
				<p>There’s a connector labeled CN3 that looks like a UART interface, but so far I haven’t seen any data coming from any of the pins.</p>
				<p>Here are some documents I found during OSINT that might be useful for understanding or reverse engineering the system:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="/docs/schematics/MT1389DE.pdf">DVD player schematic using the MT1389DE IC</a></li>
					<li><a href="/docs/datasheets/MT1389FE.pdf">MT1389FE IC datasheet</a></li>
				</ul>

				<p>I also came across another CD/DVD player board based on a different IC—the SPHE8200A, which, like the MT1389, is RISC-based. This board doesn’t have a VFD, but it does include two flash memory chips: a PLCC32 and a TSOP28. I’m not entirely sure of their roles, but my guess is that the PLCC32 holds the low-level firmware, while the TSOP28 contains a higher-level OS or application layer.</p>
				<p>There's also an SPHE6300A chip on this board. I wasn’t able to find much documentation on it, but given that it’s connected to the FFC that runs to the laser head, I suspect it’s handling the optical pickup functionality.</p>

				<p>Since both boards use CPUs based on the same architecture, they likely share the same instruction set and could potentially be debugged via JTAG in a similar way. For now, I’m focusing on the MT1389QE-based board—it’s simpler, with only one EEPROM and a cleaner layout to work with.</p>
