			<h2>Pictures of an elevator electrical panel</h2>
			<p><em>Posted on 27/06/2025</em></p>
			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Some months ago some guys were fixing the school elevator, thought i was drowing in shyness, i made sure to take some pictures of the panel :3</p>
				<p>They told me the issue was on the stop sensor</p>
				
				<p>We can see a big transformer on top left for the low voltage side</p>
				<p>Some contactors and MCBs down left</p>
				<p>A custom PCB on the top right for the elevator logic (The brand is "ELEVATOR", brilliant)</p>
				<p>Something that maybe looks like a PLC on center left</p>
				<p>Some relay boards below the main PCB, and some boards next to the PLC that look like a mains rectifier considering the fuse holder, diodes (thought it looks like it's only 3 diodes instead of 4), a capacitor and an LED</p>
				<p>Some custom connectors on the right, and terminal blocks down left</p>
				<p>And lastly, the hydraulic pump (or HPU, which means Hydraulic Power Unit), which is the heart of this kind of elevator</p>
